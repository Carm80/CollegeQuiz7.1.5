        "Options": ["RAID 0", "RAID 1", "RAID 5", "RAID 6", "RAID 10"],
        "Answer": "RAID 0",
        "Difficulty": "Easy",
        "Explanation": "RAID 0 offers striping, which splits data across multiple disks. However, it does not provide redundancy, meaning if one disk fails, all data is lost."
    },

        "Question": "Witch RAID level mirrors data across multiple disks for redundancy?",
        "Options": ["RAID 0", "RAID 1", "RAID 5", "RAID 6", "RAID 10"],
        "Answer": "RAID 1",
        "Difficulty": "Easy",
