    {
        "Question": "What RAID level combines both striping and mirroring?",
        "Options": ["RAID 0", "RAID 1", "RAID 5", "RAID 6", "RAID 10"],
        "Answer": "RAID 10",
        "Difficulty": "Medium",
        "Explanation": "RAID 10 combines striping (RAID 0) and mirroring (RAID 1). It provides both high performance and redundancy, but requires a minimum of four disks."
    },

    {
        "Question": "What is a key feature of Network Attached Storage (NAS)?",
        "Options": ["Directly attached to server", "Uses file-level storage", "Uses block-level storage", "Mirrors data"],
        "Answer": "Uses file-level storage",
        "Difficulty": "Easy",
        "Explanation": "NAS devices use file-level storage, meaning they store and serve files over a network. They are directly connected to the network, not to a specific server."
    },

    {
        "Question": "What is a key feature of Storage Area Network (SAN)?",
        "Options": ["Uses file-level storage", "Directly attached to server", "Uses block-level storage", "Mirrors data"],
        "Answer": "Uses block-level storage",
        "Difficulty": "Medium",
        "Explanation": "SANs use block-level storage, providing high-speed access to disk blocks over a network. They are typically used for mission-critical applications that require fast access to large amounts of data."
    },

    {
        "Question": "Which RAID level is best for high read and write performance with redundancy?",
        "Options": ["RAID 0","RAID 1", "RAID 5", "RAID 10"],
        "Answer": "RAID 10",
        "Difficulty": "Hard",
        "Explanation": "RAID 10 combines the benefits of RAID 0 (high performance) and RAID 1 (redundancy), making it suitable for applications that require both."
    },

    {
        "Question": "Which technology is typically easier to set up and manage, NAS or SAN",
        "Options": ["NAS", "SAN", "Both", "Neither"],
        "Answer": "SAN",
        "Difficulty": "Easy",
        "Explanation": "NAS is typically easier to set up and manage compared to SAN, as it requires less specialized knowledge and can be used by smaller organizations without a dedicated IT team."
    },

    {
        "Question": "Which storage solution provides faster data access, NAS or SAN?",
        "Options": ["NAS", "SAN", "Both", "Neither"],
        "Answer": "SAN",
        "Difficulty": "Medium",
        "Explanation": "SAN generally provides faster data access compared to NAS, as it uses high-speed networking technologies and protocols designed for enterprise-level storage."
    },

    {
        "Question": "Which RAID level would you choose for a system requiring high availability and redundancy",
        "Options": ["RAID 0", "RAID 1", "RAID 5", "RAID 6", "RAID 10"],
        "Answer": "RAID 5",
        "Difficulty": "Hard",
        "Explanation": "RAID 5 offers a good balance of availability, redundancy, and storage efficiency. It uses striping with parity, providing fault tolerance and allowing data recovery from a single disk failure."
